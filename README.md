These individuals consistently recorded high sales volumes across multiple months, suggesting a strong customer base or effective sales strategies.

2. Monthly Trends
Sales peaked in August (1.72M units) and July (1.71M units).

May and April also performed well, showing strong mid-year sales activity.

September shows a steep drop in sales (~175K units), which could be seasonal or due to incomplete data.

There‚Äôs a steady growth trend from January to August, followed by a sharp decline, indicating potential for investigation or adjustment in Q3/Q4 strategies.

AJAB NGANO 2KG was the best-selling product with 321,365 units.

Other top items include:

SOFTCARE GOLD LARGE 40 PCS

PEMBE UGALI 2 KG

SUGAR 50KG

Grain-based staples dominate the top ranks, indicating essential goods as core revenue drivers.

4. Sales Distribution
The distribution of quantities per transaction is positively skewed, suggesting that while many transactions are modest, a few large-volume orders significantly drive totals.

üß† Recommendations
‚úÖ 1. Boost Underperforming Months
Investigate causes behind September‚Äôs sales dip: Was it logistical, supply-chain, or due to reporting lag?

Plan targeted campaigns or restocking strategies during this period.

‚úÖ 2. Reward High Performers
Consider implementing an incentive program for top performers like MARIA, GLADYS, and KEVIN to retain talent and encourage internal competition.

‚úÖ 3. Product-Level Strategy
Strengthen stock and promotions around high-performing SKUs such as AJAB NGANO and PEMBE UGALI.

Evaluate the performance of low-selling items for potential phase-out or repackaging.

‚úÖ 4. Employee Support
Train or support lower-performing sales reps using data from top performers to identify gaps in:

Coverage area

Sales techniques

Product knowledge

‚úÖ 5. Monitor Stockouts or Errors
Negative sales values (e.g., KAYSALT 200G: -17 in Jan) should be audited ‚Äî may indicate returns, data entry issues, or reversal transactions.
